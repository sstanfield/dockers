Personal docker images.
These are based on Arch linux using a base image bootstapped local (should be able to replace with official image).
Probably only useful for reference, some specific stuff in them (especially in the start scripts in ./bin).

Initial dockers/inpiration taken from Jessie Frazelle's dockers: https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles
If you are looking for something that is probably a better source...
If you are an Arch Linux user and want Arch based images these might be useful.
